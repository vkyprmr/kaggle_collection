# Tabular Playground Series - September-2022
The competing Kaggle merchandise stores we saw in January's Tabular Playground are at it again. This time, they're selling books!

The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021. Can you use your data science skills to predict book sales when conditions are far from the ordinary?

### About the Tabular Playground Series
Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.

For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.
